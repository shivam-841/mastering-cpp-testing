# Mastering Unit Testing in C++

This repository contains my learning journey on mastering unit testing concepts in C++. I will be following an 8-day plan to dive deep into the fundamentals of unit testing, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. Each day will focus on one or more key topics to help improve my skills in writing effective unit tests.

---

## Day 1: Introduction to Unit Testing

### Topic: What is Unit Testing?

**Goal**: Understand the basic concept and importance of unit testing.

### Tasks:
- Read about unit testing and its role in software development.
- Understand the distinction between unit tests and other types of tests (integration, system, etc.).
- Explore the key benefits of unit testing in terms of software quality, reliability, and maintainability.

**Key Learning**:  
Unit testing ensures individual components work as expected and helps with early bug detection, continuous refactoring, and code reliability.

## Day 2: Test-driven Development (TDD)

### Topic: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Goal**: Learn about writing tests before writing code (TDD cycle).

### Tasks:
- Study the TDD cycle: Red (write a failing test), Green (write code to pass the test), Refactor (improve code without changing behavior).
- Watch a TDD demo or tutorial.
- Try writing a simple function using TDD.

**Key Learning**:  
TDD encourages writing tests first, leading to cleaner and more modular code with fewer bugs.

## Day 3: Test Case Design (Part 1)

### Topic: Test Case Design (Basics)

**Goal**: Understand the principles of designing effective test cases.

### Tasks:
- Read about key test design principles: covering a variety of scenarios, simplicity, repeatability, and independence.
- Learn how to identify inputs and expected outputs.
- Review examples of simple test cases.

**Key Learning**:  
Good test cases are focused, independent, and cover both typical and edge cases.

---

## Day 4: Test Case Design (Part 2)

### Topic: Advanced Test Case Design

**Goal**: Learn about boundary conditions, edge cases, and practical considerations in test design.

### Tasks:
- Study boundary and edge cases, such as testing the maximum and minimum input values.
- Consider the importance of handling null, empty, or invalid inputs.
- Create a few sample test cases covering typical and edge conditions.

**Key Learning**:  
Effective test case design must ensure that the software works correctly in both normal and extreme conditions.

---

## Day 5: Assertions and Their Role in Unit Testing

### Topic: Assertions

**Goal**: Understand how assertions work in unit tests.

### Tasks:
- Learn common assertions used in C++ testing frameworks (e.g., `ASSERT_EQ`, `EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_FALSE`).
- Understand the difference between `ASSERT_*` and `EXPECT_*`.
- Write a few basic unit tests using assertions (using a framework like Google Test).

**Key Learning**:  
Assertions validate that the actual output of a function matches the expected output and help in identifying test failures.

---

## Day 6: Test Failure vs. Test Success

### Topic: Test Failure vs. Test Success

**Goal**: Learn to interpret test results and handle failures.

### Tasks:
- Understand what constitutes a successful test and a failing test.
- Review examples of both passing and failing tests.
- Practice writing tests that fail initially and then fix them to pass.

**Key Learning**:  
Interpreting failures is critical in debugging and improving code quality, and failure scenarios often give the most insights.

---

## Day 7: Testing Levels

### Topic: Testing Levels (Unit, Integration, System, etc.)

**Goal**: Understand different levels of testing in the software development life cycle.

### Tasks:
- Study the difference between unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
- Learn why unit tests are important at the early stages of development.
- Understand how unit testing fits into the larger testing strategy.

**Key Learning**:  
Unit tests are focused on individual components, while integration and system tests focus on interactions between components.

---

## Day 8: Test Coverage

### Topic: Test Coverage

**Goal**: Learn about the importance of code coverage in unit testing.

### Tasks:
- Study different types of test coverage (line, branch, and path coverage).
- Explore tools for measuring code coverage (e.g., `gcov` for C++).
- Practice writing tests and calculating the coverage of the code.

**Key Learning**:  
High test coverage doesnâ€™t guarantee bug-free code, but it ensures that critical paths of the code are being tested.

---

## Conclusion

By following this structured 8-day plan, I will learn the fundamentals of unit testing, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. This will enable me to write more reliable and maintainable C++ code with robust testing practices.

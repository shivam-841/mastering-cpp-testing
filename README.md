## 1. Fundamentals of Unit Testing

- **What is Unit Testing?**: Basic concept and importance of unit testing.
- **Test-driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before writing code.
- **Test Case Design**: How to design effective test cases.
- **Assertions**: Basic test assertions (e.g., `ASSERT_EQ`, `EXPECT_TRUE`).
- **Test Failure vs. Test Success**: Understanding when a test passes or fails.
- **Testing Levels**: Unit tests, integration tests, system tests, etc.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensuring all parts of the code are tested.
- **Boundary Conditions and Edge Cases**: Testing for special conditions.

## 2. Test Frameworks for C++

- **Google Test (gtest)**:
  - Writing and organizing tests.
  - Common assertions (`ASSERT_EQ`, `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc.).
  - Test fixtures for setup and teardown.
  - Running tests and generating reports.
- **Google Mock**:
  - Creating mocks and stubs.
  - Mocking functions and classes to simulate dependencies.
- **Catch2**:
  - Syntax and features of Catch2.
  - Writing test cases using BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) style.
- **Doctest**:
  - Lightweight framework with simple syntax.
  - Writing simple and fast tests.
- **Boost.Test**:
  - Using Boost’s testing libraries for more advanced test cases.
  - Writing unit tests with different test runners.

## 3. Test Design Concepts

- **Test Organization**: Grouping and naming tests properly.
- **Test Fixtures**: Using `SetUp` and `TearDown` to prepare tests.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Writing tests that work with multiple input sets.
- **Test Independence**: Ensuring tests are independent of each other.
- **Mocking and Stubbing**: Using mock objects and stubs to isolate units.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Injecting dependencies for easier unit testing.
- **Isolation of Units**: Making sure tests are isolated from each other and external systems (e.g., databases, file systems).

## 4. Advanced Unit Testing Techniques

- **Memory Management in Tests**: Dealing with smart pointers, raw pointers, and memory leaks.
- **Testing Multithreaded Code**: Writing tests for thread safety, race conditions, and synchronization.
- **Exception Handling**: Writing tests for functions that throw exceptions.
- **Code Coverage**:
  - Tools like **gcov**, **lcov**, or **BullseyeCoverage** to analyze test coverage.
  - Branch and path coverage.
- **Performance Testing**: Writing tests to measure performance or response time.
- **Mocking Libraries**: Using advanced mocking libraries (e.g., **Google Mock**, **FakeIt**).

## 5. Integration with Build Systems

- **CMake Integration**: Adding unit tests to your CMake configuration.
- **Makefiles**: Setting up tests in traditional Makefile-based builds.
- **Test Suites**: Creating and running multiple tests together in a suite.
- **Test Reporting**: Generating reports from test runs.
- **Handling External Dependencies**: Testing components that depend on external services, databases, etc.

## 6. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **CI/CD Concepts**: Understanding how CI tools (e.g., **GitHub Actions**, **Travis CI**, **Jenkins**) integrate with unit testing.
- **Running Tests on Every Commit**: Automatically running tests during the build process.
- **Test Results in CI**: Parsing and interpreting test results in CI systems.
- **Test Failures in CI**: Handling failed tests in CI pipelines and notifying the team.

## 7. Static and Dynamic Analysis

- **Static Code Analysis**: Using tools like **Clang-Tidy** and **CppCheck** to identify potential issues in code before testing.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Using tools like **Valgrind**, **AddressSanitizer**, and **ThreadSanitizer** to find runtime issues (memory leaks, threading issues).

## 8. Testing Techniques for Real-World Scenarios

- **Mocking File I/O and Network Calls**: Testing code that interacts with external systems.
- **Database Testing**: Writing unit tests for code that interacts with databases.
- **Service Testing**: Writing unit tests for network services (REST APIs, etc.).
- **Testing Libraries or Frameworks**: Unit testing custom libraries or application frameworks.
- **Test Data Management**: Managing test data for realistic test cases.

## 9. Performance and Stress Testing

- **Performance Benchmarks**: Writing tests to benchmark functions and algorithms.
- **Stress Testing**: Ensuring that components handle extreme conditions or high loads.
- **Profiling**: Using profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your tests.

## 10. Test Refactoring and Maintenance

- **Refactoring Test Code**: Improving the structure and clarity of test code without changing its behavior.
- **Test Code Reviews**: Best practices for reviewing test code in teams.
- **Test Data Isolation**: Managing and cleaning up test data during test execution.
- **Dealing with Test Flakiness**: Identifying and resolving tests that sometimes fail due to environmental issues (e.g., timing issues in multithreaded tests).
- **Removing Duplicate Tests**: Ensuring tests are not redundant.

## 11. Test Framework and Tool Ecosystem

- **Test Execution Tools**: Using command-line tools or integrated development environments (IDEs) to execute and debug tests.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Writing tests that capture logs and debugging output for easier diagnosis.
- **Test Runners**: Understanding the use of test runners that can execute a set of tests and aggregate the results (e.g., **CTest**, **Google Test’s test runner**).
- **Test Reporting and Visualization**: Generating readable and actionable reports for developers (e.g., using **JUnit XML**, **Cucumber**, or **Allure**).

## 12. Documentation and Communication

- **Documenting Tests**: Writing clear and concise documentation for your unit tests.
- **Communicating with Developers**: Understanding the code you're testing and effectively communicating issues with developers.
- **Test-Driven Design (TDD)**: Learning how to write code using TDD and its relation to unit testing.
